# VulcanCoin
Hold long and Prosper!

// VulcanCoin - People's crypto - Hold long and Prosper! 
//
// VulcanCoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that belongs to the people who hold it. 
// Vulcan is an automatic burning cryptocurrency with zero user fee contract.
// Vulcan was designed to be a simple and efficient highly deflationary asset, with a limited supply that will only decrease in time. 
// The deflationary nature of Vulcan is implemented by a function that burns 0.1% of the value of every  single transaction from a locked account (burn account) containing 30% of the total supply (6.300.000 coins). 
// The burn account is locked and the coins it contains cannot be transferred to a different address other than the burn TO address.
// Once the burnable supply of 6.3M Vulcan is finished, the total supply of Vulcan will be stable at 14.700.000 coins. 
// New Vulcan coins cannot be minted. 
// Like Bitcoin, Vulcan has a limited maximum supply of only 21 million coins (21,000,000). 
// Unlike Bitcoin, the 21M coins are pre-mined and will decrease in number in time due to transaction burning.
// The pre-mined nature of VulcanCoin makes it a Clean Energy asset, in contrast to the cryptocurrencies that demand constant mining.
